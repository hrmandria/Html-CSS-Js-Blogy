# Html-CSS-Js-Blogy
A blog made with HTML/CSS and Javascript, 
you are able to visit the blog directly by clicking here, https://hrmdbipolar.github.io/Html-CSS-Js-Blogy/
Else, I advise you to open the project with VS Code, click on index.html and open with live server.

Please make sure you allow the audio from the website to play on your browser. For that, you will have to click on the settings icon on top of the page and choose: allow audio.
Thank you.
