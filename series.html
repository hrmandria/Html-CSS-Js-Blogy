                                  Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone is an enthralling start to Harry’s journey toward coming to terms with his past and facing his future. It was the first book written by Rowling, and she was praised for creating well-rounded characters and a fully realized wizard universe that coexisted with the present world. An almost immediate critical and popular success, it was translated into some 60 languages. The six later novels about Harry’s further adventures at Hogwarts were equally popular. 
                                  The film Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone (2001) was also a blockbuster.

                                  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets begins 
                                  when Harry is spending a miserable summer with his only remaining family, 
                                  the Dursleys. During a dinner party hosted by his uncle and aunt, 
                                  Harry is visited by Dobby, a house-elf. Dobby warns Harry not to return 
                                  to Hogwarts, the magical school for wizards that Harry attended the previous 
                                  year. Harry politely disregards the warning, and Dobby wreaks havoc in the 
                                  kitchen, infuriating the Dursleys. The Dursleys angrily imprison Harry in his
                                   room for the rest of the summer. Luckily, Harry's friend Ron Weasley steals
                                    Harry away in a flying car, 
                                  and Harry happily spends the rest of the summer at the Weasley home.

                                  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban opens on 
                                  the night before Harry's thirteenth birthday, when he receives gifts
                                   by Owl Post from his friends at school. The next morning at breakfast,
                                    Harry sees on television that a man named Black is on the loose from prison. 
                                    At this time, Aunt Marge comes to stay with the Dursleys, and she insults
                                     Harry's parents numerous times. Harry accidentally causes her to inflate.
                                      Harry leaves the Dursley's house and is picked up by the Knight Bus, but
                                       only after an alarming sighting of a large, black dog. The Knight Bus 
                                       drops Harry off at Diagon Alley, where he is greeted by Cornelius Fudge,
                                        the Minister of Magic.

                                  with a description of how the Riddle family was mysteriously 
                                  killed at supper, and their groundsman, Frank Bryce, was suspected 
                                  of the crime, then declared innocent. Frank Bryce, now an elderly man
                                  , wakes in the night to see a light in the window of the abandoned Riddle 
                                  House. He investigates and overhears Voldemort and Wormtail plotting to kill 
                                  a boy named Harry Potter. Voldemort takes note 
                                  of him and kills him on the spot. Harry Potter 
                                  wakes up in the night with a throbbing pain in 
                                  the scar Voldemort gave him. He worries that 
                                  Voldemort is nearby, and he writes to Sirius Black,
                                   his godfather, mentioning the pain in his scar.

                                  Harry Potter is spending another tedious summer with 
                                  his dreadful Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon when a group of 
                                  evil spirits called “dementors” stage an unexpected attack on
                                   Harry and his cousin Dudley. After using magic to defend himself, 
                                   Harry is visited by a group of wizards and whisked off to number twelve,
                                    Grimmauld Place, London. Number twelve is the home of Harry’s godfather, 
                                    Sirius Black, and the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix. 
                                    The Order is a group of wizards, led by Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore,
                                    dedicated to fighting evil Lord Voldemort and his followers. 
                                    The Order is forced to operate in secrecy, outside of the jurisdiction
                                     of the Ministry of Magic, which is headed by the dense and corrupt
                                      Cornelius Fudge.
                                   Fudge refuses to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned.

                                  from his aunt and uncle. On their way to the Burrow, 
                                  Harry and Dumbledore stop to recruit Horace Slughorn 
                                  to return to teaching at Hogwarts. Harry is reunited with
                                   his best friends, Ron and Hermione. When shopping for schoolbooks,
                                    Harry runs into Draco and follows him to Borgin and Burkes, where he 
                                    overhears Draco threatening Borgin and insisting that he fix an unknown 
                                    object. Harry is instantly suspicious of Draco, whom he believes to be a 
                                    Death Eater, just like his father. The students return to school, 
                                    and Dumbledore announces that Snape 
                                  will be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts, much to Harry’s surprise.

                                  stating that the Ministry remains strong despite Lord Voldemort gaining
                                   power and the Death Eaters committing mass killings of Muggles and

                                    gave Harry by hunting down and destroying Voldemort's Horcruxes. Severus
                                     Snape informs Voldemort of Harry's impending departure from Privet Drive.

                                  along with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, break into Bellatrix Lestrange's 
                                  vault at Gringotts bank, suspecting a Horcrux may be there. Griphook agrees, 
                                  in exchange for the Sword of Gryffindor. Wandmaker Ollivander tells Harry that 
                                  two wands taken from Malfoy Manor belonged to Bellatrix and Draco Malfoy, 
                                  though Draco's has changed its allegiance to Harry. In the vault, they discover
                                  nother Horcrux: Helga Hufflepuff's cup. Harry retrieves it,
                                   but Griphook snatches the sword and abandons them. Trapped by security,
                                    they release the dragon guardian and flee on its back. Harry has a vision 
                                    of Lord Voldemort at Gringotts, furious at the theft.
